# Character-Cookbook
## Bookshelf

This folder is used as an internal library system that the application will use in order to find informations such as stats and skills that come with certain classes, descriptions for spells & loot, anything likewise.

The reason for adding such a system is firstly to allow homebrew, but it is also with the hope that we could later expand the application to more than just DND character sheets.

Currently, the libraries are stored in different folders (such as, but not limited to: Classes, Races, Spells...)
I (Pomm2Terr) will set a "default" library containing the content of the DND Player's Handbook to be able to create characters freely.
